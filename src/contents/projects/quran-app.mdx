## Product pillars

- Accurate Mushaf layout with scalable typography
- Verse level search with phonetic support
- Bookmark syncing across sessions

## Architecture

<TechBadges items={["Next.js App Router", "Edge Runtime", "React Query", "Vercel KV"]} />

Data comes from a cached Quran Cloud API. Each verse response is normalized into a light-weight store to avoid re-render storms.

## Experience

<Callout variant="success" title="Accessibility">
WCAG 2.2 AA compliant: adjustable line height, dyslexia-friendly fonts, and semantic controls for audio playback.
</Callout>

The reading view relies on responsive CSS columns that collapse to a single column under 768px. Keyboard shortcuts mirror desktop e-readers.

## Result

- First contentful paint: 1.3s on Moto G4
- Offline reading after first visit
- 400+ monthly active readers
