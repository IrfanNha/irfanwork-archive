## Security model

The app never sends entropy over the network. Keys are generated fully offline and can be exported as JSON, WIF, or printable paper wallets.

<Callout variant="warning" title="Threat model">
We assume a trusted device but untrusted network. CSP locks down third-party scripts and workers handle heavy crypto to keep the UI responsive.
</Callout>

## Implementation

<TechBadges items={["elliptic", "crypto.subtle", "Zod validation", "TanStack Query"]} />

```ts
const computeKeypair = async (seed: Uint8Array) => {
  const ec = new EC("secp256k1");
  const key = ec.keyFromPrivate(seed);
  return {
    privateKey: key.getPrivate("hex"),
    publicKey: key.getPublic("hex"),
    address: key.getPublic().encode("hex"),
  };
};
```

## Impact

- Generated 5K+ addresses without a single reported collision
- Export to .csv or .json for safe cold storage
- Responsive dashboard works on 320px width
