## Strategy

The new portfolio focuses on clarity, high information density, and smooth motion. I mapped every section (hero, specialties, project reels, blog teasers) to a user journey, then defined interaction contracts for keyboard users, screen readers, and touch devices.

<Callout title="Design Goals" icon="✨">
Ship a layout that feels editorial, keeps cumulative layout shift under 0.01, and renders meaningful content in less than 1s on a 4G connection.
</Callout>

## Tech Decisions

<TechBadges items={["Next.js 15 App Router", "Server Components", "Tailwind CSS 4", "Framer Motion 12"]} />

I kept the bundle lean by aggressively tree-shaking shadcn components, co-locating motion variants, and using static data for most sections. Complex interactions (theme switcher, GitHub stats) live in small client islands.

## Visual System

<Image src="/projects/portfolio.png" alt="Portfolio landing page" width={1280} height={720} />

The typography grid uses a 1.25 modular scale and CSS variables for dark/light themes. Custom gradients and blurred highlights are implemented with CSS Houdini paint API fallbacks.

## Outcomes

- Lighthouse 99/100/100/100 on both desktop and mobile
- Bounce rate dropped by 28% thanks to clearer CTAs
- Publishing new case studies now takes ~5 minutes via MDX
